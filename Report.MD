# Introduction
Fiscal balance is a key indicator of economic sustainability, reflecting the difference between government revenues and expenditures. A surplus indicates fiscal strength, while a deficit signals potential vulnerability. This project leverages the Africa Fiscal Balance & Sustainability Dashboard to analyze the fiscal positions of selected African countries between 2021 and 2025. 
The dashboard provides insights into deficits, surpluses, and overall regional trends, enabling policymakers and stakeholders to assess fiscal health and sustainability.

# Objectives
- To evaluate the fiscal balance of African countries over time.

- To identify countries with the largest deficits and surpluses.

- To highlight regional trends and sustainability challenges.

- To provide actionable recommendations for improving fiscal stability.
