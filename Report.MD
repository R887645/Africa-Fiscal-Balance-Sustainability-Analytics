# Introduction
Fiscal balance is a key indicator of economic sustainability, reflecting the difference between government revenues and expenditures. A surplus indicates fiscal strength, while a deficit signals potential vulnerability. This project leverages the Africa Fiscal Balance & Sustainability Dashboard to analyze the fiscal positions of selected African countries between 2021 and 2025. 
The dashboard provides insights into deficits, surpluses, and overall regional trends, enabling policymakers and stakeholders to assess fiscal health and sustainability.

# Objectives
- To evaluate the fiscal balance of African countries over time.

- To identify countries with the largest deficits and surpluses.

- To highlight regional trends and sustainability challenges.

- To provide actionable recommendations for improving fiscal stability.

# Methodology

- **Data Source:** Fiscal data collected from country-level financial records.

- **Visualization Tools:** Interactive dashboard with bar charts, line charts, maps, and summary cards.

- **Metrics Analyzed:**

  - Net fiscal balance (aggregate deficit/surplus).

  - Largest deficit and surplus by country.

 - Number of countries in deficit vs. surplus.

 - Trends across years (2021–2025).

# Key Findings

- **Overall Position:** Africa’s combined fiscal balance is **($220.84M)**, showing a significant regional deficit.

- **Deficit Leaders:**

  - Nigeria dominates with **($199M)**, accounting for nearly **90%** of the total deficit.

  - Egypt ($16M) and South Africa **($4M)** also contribute notable shortfalls.

- **Surplus Contributors:**

  - Only South Africa **($77K)** and Ghana **($8K)** record meaningful surpluses.

  - Total surplus across all countries is just **$3.64M**, far below the deficit total.
